This repository holds all the code necessary for a custom _printf function to run.
The  mini-version currently handles conversion specifiers: c, s, %, d, i, b, o
It also does support field width, precision, flag characters, or length modifiers. 
Unique to this are:
1. r reverse conversion
2. R rot13 conversion. 
In essence, you can print any character, string, integer, or decimal number, reverse your strings,
transform any number to binary and octal bases, and encrypt your string with rot13 encryption.
